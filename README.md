# RREF Solver

This is a project developed for my Numerical Methods class.
It takes the method Reduced Row Echelon Form to solve any sized Matrix.

## Features
- RREF Solver
- 5 Test Cases
- Random Case to choose any sized Matrix (5x5, 10x10, etc.)
- Compares how fast my RREF Solver is to LU Decomposition, or the backslash method
